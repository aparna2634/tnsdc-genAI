# Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN and Keras
# Problem Statement
The project aims to develop an AI-based system for accurately recognizing and interpreting traffic signs from images, enhancing safety and efficiency in transportation systems. The system involves collecting and preprocessing labelled traffic sign images, training a CNN model with optimized hyperparameters, and evaluating its performance on a separate test dataset. This project involves exploring efficient deployment strategies for integrating the model into real-world applications.
